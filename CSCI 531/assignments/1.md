# Assignment 1

## Task 1

1. The plaintext is APPLICATIONS OF CRYPTOGRAPHY AND CRYPTANALYSIS.

2. The result Ci is equal to Mi because each encryption shifts the characters by 13, and two such encryptions shift a total of 26. This is equivalent to no shift at all.
3. 13 encryptions are needed, because a shift by a multiple of 26 characters is equivalent to no shift, and 13 shifts of K = 2 is equal to a shift by 26 characters.

## Task 2

Histograms for both the plain text and the cipher text are shown in the figure below. The histogram for the cipher text is a shifted version of the histogram for the plain text. For example, both peak at the letter E (or its corresponding cipher text H) with a maximum frequency of 10.14%, which can be use to determine the key for the Caesar cipher.
