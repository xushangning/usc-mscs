1. Cryptography helps with confidentiality by encrypting the message content with ciphers. It ensures integrity of data with cryptographic signatures. Non-repudiation is solved with public key cryptography. Crypto techniques generally don't enhance availability as it restricts rather than provides access.
2. To attack ciphers, we can use a brute-force attack to try to recover the original key, and we can exploit inherent weakness in the cipher algorithms to reduce the size of key space we are going to search. We can use a side-channel attacks to try to derive the key during computation. There is also cryptanalysis.
3. Security of cryptographic algorithms is like the security of open source software. More times the algorithm itself is examined and attacked, more secure the algorithm is considered to be. On the other hand, it's easier to change the keys then to replace an insecure algorithm. Algorithms used over the public internet should best be open.
