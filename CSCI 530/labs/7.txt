1. The smallest value that triggers an alert is 801.
2. Files that start with snort.log contain complete sniffed packets in the tcpdump format and serve as a log for future reference. The alert file is plain-text and contains alerts triggered by packets. It warns system administrators about potential intrusions and should be read by them as soon as possible.
3. Xref provides a hyperlink that contains information about the detected intrusion e.g., what kind of intrusion it just detected or what vulnerability a packet tries to exploit.
4. The rule mandates that snort should issue an alert to the "alert" file when a TCP segment is sent from the local TCP port 23 to any remote host's any port that contains the string "Login incorrect." When such an alert is issued, its title should be "TELNET login incorrect." The rule is used to detect attempts to log in from a remote system through the telnet protocol with an incorrect password, which may indicate illegal access attempts.
   The "msg" string "TELNET login incorrect" dictates the content of the alert when the rule is triggered and the "content" string "Login incorrect" is used to specify a condition that triggers the rule i.e., containing the string.
